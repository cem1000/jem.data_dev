##How to read and write to google sheets files from R

##1. 
install.packages("googlesheets4") ## step 1! Lets first download the required package. I have already installed so will just unpack instead. 

##2.  
library(googlesheets4)   ##now its loaded. 

##3. 
gs4_auth() ##next we need to authenticate. Done. Access token received and authorised. 


## next we will read the dataframe from sheets into R. All we need is the URL of the sheet and use function read_sheet to read the DF

##3.  #now, in order to read sheets file, all we need to use is the "read_sheet" function from the package and attached it to an object"
df <- read_sheet("URL of Google Sheets Here") ##insert data


##and thats it! We now have read the dataframe and stored it locally in our session. 


###How to write to google sheets files from R ##next lets look at how we can write to google sheets from R.

##1.
library("dplyr") ##Lets now load dplyr package. We will need a function to write data to later   


##2.
ss = "SHEET ID (46 characthers in lenght, can be found in URL of sheet)" ##now, lets take this ID from the URL of the sheet and name it to an object 'SS'.
##3. 
data.frame(iris) %>% sheet_write(ss, sheet = 'flowers') 

##now all we need to do is use function sheet_write and place SS in the first argument and the sheet title in the second. 


### how easy was that? :)
